"""Main-thread (UI) hygiene.

One tool to see what quietly runs on the 3ds Max main/UI thread — redraw-views
callbacks, live .NET timers held in globals, general-callback count, playback
state — and to kill/disable a specific hook. callbacks.show() alone misses
timers and per-redraw callbacks; this fills that gap. Backed by the native
bridge (native:main_thread).

    that interrupted another MCP call (that call returns BLOCKED_BY_DIALOG).

    inspect: every blocking dialog with title, text, buttons (label, kind,
    enabled, default, role, checked), fields, which MCP calls it interrupted
    (during_requests) and expected_dialog; blocked_calls with the status or
    final result of interrupted calls; recent_actions.
    respond: press one button. Pass dialog_id and expected_dialog from a fresh
    inspect and button as its label or index; a changed dialog is refused.
    Then waits up to wait_seconds for interrupted calls to finish and returns
    their results, or the next dialog holding them. A blocked call whose
    connection broke is reported with status "lost" (outcome unknown): inspect
    the scene before running it again.
    Only dialogs on Max's main thread can be read and pressed. One on another
    thread (main_thread false, e.g. a plugin's worker) is listed but never read,
    and pressing it fails with DIALOG_NOT_ON_MAIN_THREAD: ask the user to answer it
    in Max. A bridge without the dialog monitor (before 1.7.5) gives BRIDGE_OUTDATED.

    Answering is a decision. Choose yourself only when the user authorized
    unattended work and the task determines the answer. Otherwise show the
    user the dialog and ask; always ask before saving, overwriting, discarding
    changes (Save / Don't Save), Fetch, Reset or licensing choices, even when
    working unattended. Pressing posts a click; check what followed. Never repeat an interrupted call while it is waiting.
    Automatic: Script Controller Exception boxes are closed; recognized
    MAXScript error boxes with a sole OK are acknowledged during MCP calls,
    which then fail with MAX_DIALOG_ERROR. Requires the native bridge.
